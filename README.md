### Hi there <img src="./assets/hi.gif" width="35" />

I'm a french engineer student at Polytech Grenoble.
Passionate about computer science since I discovered this field I always try to improve myself while taking a lot of fun by developing new projects! üòÅ

For my personal projects I mainly use Java and more precisly <a href="https://processing.org/">Processing</a> for graphic project (Processing is basically an easier version of Java focused on graphics).
But I know how to code in many languages and how to use many tools thanks to others projects and school projects :

On some projects I like to do a presentation video (no talking, no bullshit, only showcase), check this out there :
